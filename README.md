## Overview
This program helps students keep track of their schedule, tasks, grades, and helps them study with flash cards during online studying.

You can create and manage to-do lists, manage schedules, calculate your GPA and create and study flash card sets.

## How to use
When the program is initially run you are met with a menu of options. Going through the menu will lead you to one of the program's many functions.

## How it works

### Technology

- This project was coded in Python 3
- External libraries used: [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/), random


### File Structure
- 1 main file
- a python file for the tabulate library
- 1 txt file for the to-do list
- a folder with a file for each flash card set
- a file for each day of schedule

### Problems
Coding different parts on different computers and then combining them was challenging at times, but we managed to update the code to work together.

### Running the Project
Run main.py in Python 3

# Other

## Future imporvements

- Fix known issues.
- Provide a better visual experience (provide a UI insted of a command line).

## Issues

Creating a new study set with an already existing name overwrites the already existing set.

## Additional Info
Not all aspects covered in demo video due to the time limit.

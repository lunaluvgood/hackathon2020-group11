## Overview
This program helps students keep track of their schedule, tasks, grades, and helps them study with flash cards during online studying.

You can create and manage to-do lists, manage schedules, calculate your GPA and create and study flash card sets.

## How to use
When the program is initially run you are met with a menu of options. Going through the menu will lead you to one of the program's many functions.
